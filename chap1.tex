\chapter{Background and requirements}

The Whakatōhea are a Māori tribe located in the Eastern Bay region on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. However in the past the tribe has faced challenges such as land loss, the tribe is committed to preserving and maintaining its traditional values and way of life. Our aim in creating the digital library is to preserve the tribe's history, traditional knowledge and cultural heritage in order to prevent these valuable resources from being lost or forgotten in the onslaught of time. The digital library will help to pass on the culture by allowing the younger generation to better understand and learn about their traditional culture and history.

The digital library will provide curriculum education for young people (13-18 years old). The Māori language curriculum for different grades will be integrated into textbooks and provide a Māori language learning environment for young people. For this digital library, the most basic requirements we need to do are how to convert the e-books, how to enter the e-books into the back-end database, and how to display it on the front-end to complete its deletion, change and search functions. The e-books are categorised to require the corresponding age group and the relevant history to be found in the search process.
