The Whakatōhea, a Māori tribe situated in the Eastern Bay region on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, has encountered challenges such as land loss in the past. Their commitment lies in the preservation and upkeep of their traditional values and way of life\autocite{Whakatoh25:online}. Our objective in establishing the digital library is to safeguard the tribe's history, traditional knowledge, and cultural heritage, ensuring these valuable resources are not lost or forgotten over time. By means of the digital library, the younger generation will have an enhanced understanding and learning experience of their traditional culture and history.

The digital library will incorporate Māori language learning materials into textbooks and create an environment for Māori language learning, thereby offering a curriculum designed for young individuals aged 13-18 years old. Key requirements for this digital library encompass the conversion of e-books, inputting them into the backend database, and presenting them on the frontend to enable functions like deletion, modification, and search. The e-books will be classified based on age groups and relevant historical topics, facilitating the search process.
