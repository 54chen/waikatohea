\chapter{Background and requirements}

The Whakatōhea are a Māori tribe located in the Eastern Bay region on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. However, in the past, the tribe has faced challenges such as land loss. The tribe is committed to preserving and maintaining its traditional values and way of life. Our aim in creating the digital library is to preserve the tribe's history, traditional knowledge, and cultural heritage to prevent these valuable resources from being lost or forgotten over time. The digital library will help pass on the culture by allowing the younger generation to better understand and learn about their traditional culture and history.

The digital library will provide a curriculum for young people (aged 13-18 years old) that integrates Māori language learning materials into textbooks and provides a Māori language learning environment. For this digital library, the basic requirements include converting e-books, entering them into the back-end database, and displaying them on the front-end to enable deletion, change, and search functions. The e-books will be categorized by age group and relevant historical topics to aid in the search process.
