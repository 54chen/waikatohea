\subsection{Project Direction}
Our project can be made into a digital library of Māori culture, which aims to collect, preserve, display and disseminate the Māori cultural heritage online platform.

The Māori Cultural Library initially provides curriculum education to young people (13-18 years old). It integrates Māori language lessons into textbooks and provides a Māori language learning environment for teenagers.

Digital Collection of Māori Cultural Heritage: The Māori Cultural Digital Library collects important Māori heritage such as traditional culture, history, art and language through digital technology, forming a digital cultural database, so that more people can easily access and understand Māori culture.

Promoting the inheritance and development of Māori culture: The Digital Library of Māori Culture is not only a platform for the collection and preservation of cultural heritage, but also an important tool for promoting the inheritance and development of Māori culture. Through digital display and dissemination, more people can learn and understand Māori culture, and help Māori themselves better protect and pass on their own culture.

Providing education and research resources: The Digital Library of Māori Culture is not only a showcase, it also provides a wealth of education and research resources, so that students, teachers and researchers can understand and study Māori culture more deeply, and promote the development of Māori cultural research.

Collaboration with other cultural digital libraries: Māori cultural digital libraries can collaborate with other cultural digital libraries to share cultural resources and experiences and enhance cultural exchange and understanding. In this way, more people can know about Māori culture, and at the same time, Māori can better understand and respect other cultures.

Protecting and inheriting the sustainability of Māori Culture: The Māori Cultural Digital Library is an important tool for protecting and inheriting Māori culture, which needs to be constantly updated and improved to ensure the sustainability of Māori cultural heritage. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively participate in community cultural activities to promote the development and inheritance of Māori culture.
 
\section{Background analysis}
\subsection{Digital library}
Digital library refers to the library that uses digital technology to store, organize, retrieve, transmit, utilize and protect document resources. Different from traditional physical libraries, digital libraries are mainly dominated by literature resources in electronic form, which can be retrieved and accessed through computer networks. Digital library is the product of the information age. It uses the digital way to manage the document resources, which makes it more convenient for people to obtain and use the information resources, and also provides a broader space for academic research and education.

Digital library is of great significance to academic research and education. It provides more extensive and deeper information resources for education and research, and provides a more convenient and efficient learning, research and teaching platform for scholars, researchers and students. At the same time, digital library also provides a wider range of cultural and knowledge resources for the society, and promotes cultural exchange and knowledge innovation.
