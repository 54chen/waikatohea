Based on the feedback from the previous presentation, we realized that our focus on the digital library was misplaced and that we should concentrate on the ebook. As a result, we will be implementing a map function to showcase MƒÅori culture. We also received feedback during our weekly meetings that the digital library would benefit from a feature that allows for searching in various formats such as songs, making it easier for users to access information. To address this, we have improved the search function to support audio searches. Additionally, we recognize the importance of developing a community culture that facilitates cultural exchange between different tribes and the international community. This will promote cultural diversity and cross-cultural understanding.

At present, we have developed a basic model for integrating the front-end and back-end of our system. We plan to add more functions in the future, including intelligent features that could assist users who face accessibility challenges. For example, we may explore the possibility of implementing an assistance function on the desktop to help blind users interact with the system. Additionally, we plan to develop testing functions to support learning about Maori culture for students, among other educational goals.
