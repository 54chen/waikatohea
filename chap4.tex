Based on the feedback from the previous discussion, we initially had a prototype with only text input for the search function. However, considering the specific needs of some users and the functionality of search, we added a voice input feature for searching. We also implemented a pop-up window for converting voice to text. Additionally, we lacked details on accessing ebooks in our original model, so we added a download ebooks feature in the download list for users to view and download ebooks at any time. Furthermore, we recognized the need for user interaction with the digital library and to achieve our goal of promoting indigenous culture. Hence, we included community interaction and quizzes to enhance user engagement.

We have currently achieved the basic integration of the frontend and backend models, which can adequately fulfill the usage and development of a digital library platform. In the future, there may be design enhancements to the user interface to engage the interest of young users. However, our initial goal for creating the digital library was to target teenagers, and subsequent improvements may be best suited for the general public. This will facilitate the increasing number of people learning about tribal culture.
